# SmartDose

Welcome to SmartDose. This is an iOS machine learning based application that identifies unknown foods and assists type one diabetics in calculating insulin dosages.
From a model of over 120,000 images, the application uses the camera to identify over 160 potential foods and provide carbohydrate information.
Using saved insulin profiles, type 1 diabetics can plug in blood sugars and meal time carbs to assist in insulin dosage calculations. 

I developed this project initially on my own, but submitted an early version to the Baker Insitute at Lehigh University.
I was approved to continue developing the app as funded undergraduate research with a faculty advisor, Professor Roberto Palmieri. 
The completed application was featured in the #CreativityLivesatLehigh social media campaign, and Lehigh's spring expo.

Please note that the folder DiabetesCalculatorv2 contains the finished application, the SmartDose folder contains an older build.
